Lecture - ( Vectors in C++ )

-> Vectors look same like as an array
-> They are dynamic in nature mean size is not fixed
-> STL is Standard Template Library in which some code of these datastructures is already implemented.
Like :- stack , queue etc 
-> From this library we pick these already implemented datastructure as a tool and then we use that in our code.
-> Vector is also a tool whose implementation is already done in STL.
-> All these datastructures are known as STL containers whose implementation is already done in STL
-> To access vector values
for(auto v : vec) then print v
This will work as a foreach loop for a vector , Here above v will stored values not a index like for loop 

Vectors Functions :- These we use to perform some kind of operations
size , push_back , pop_back , front , back , at
